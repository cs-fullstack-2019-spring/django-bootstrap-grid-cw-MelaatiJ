<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<article>My name is Melaat jayah and this is my Get to know me in three slides preview. I tend to like to create everything about myself as
a software developer haha!. I was a restaurant manager for 5 years at Redkoi Japanese cuisine. red Koi is not only where i worked but it
    is also my favorite restaurant ever. I consistently ate there and even on my days off i would grab a bite. I have probably gained
    50 pounds working there and the number is still rising. Now im on my journey to become a software developer and it has
    been nothing but an amazing experience so far. We have great instructors and they know their stuff! </h2>
